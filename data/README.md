# Data Folder 📁

This folder contains the starter data for the project.

The data provided was malformed, so a sanitization was needed.

For study purpouse, I'll maintain the malformed data and the `sh script` with the correction.

## Instructions

### Permission to run the `sh`

```sh
# first you need to make the correct_malformed_data the permission to be executed
chmod +x ./correct_malformed_data.sh
```

### Run the correction

```sh
./correct_malformed_data.sh
```

## Thats all!
